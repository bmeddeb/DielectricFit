# DielectricFit Development Session Notes

## Current Status (as of August 9, 2025)

### ✅ Completed Features

1. **Active Project System** - Fully implemented and working
   - Users have an "active project" that determines where uploads go
   - Smart default creation when users have no projects
   - Project switching interface with modal

2. **Dashboard UI Redesign** - Complete
   - Removed KPI cards (Datasets, Analyses, Today counts)
   - Large upload dropzone and project card (2-column grid)
   - Perfect square dataset cards with improved proportions
   - Dataset filtering by active project only

3. **Project Management** - Fully functional
   - Create new projects (name, description, visibility)
   - Switch between projects via modal interface
   - Delete projects (with dataset cascade warning)
   - Auto-fallback when deleting active project

4. **Upload System Integration**
   - Files upload directly to active project
   - Real-time card addition without page refresh
   - Project context displayed in upload area

### 🔧 Current Implementation Details

#### Key Files Modified:
- `dielectric/models.py` - Added Project, ProjectMembership, UserProjectPreference models
- `dielectric/views.py` - Added project APIs and updated dashboard logic
- `templates/dielectric/dashboard_clean.html` - Redesigned layout
- `static/dielectric/js/dashboard.js` - Project management functionality
- `dielectric/urls.py` - Added project API endpoints

#### Database Schema:
```sql
-- Core project tables are created and populated
Project (id, name, description, visibility, created_by, dataset_count, etc.)
ProjectMembership (project, user, role, joined_at, access_count)  
UserProjectPreference (user, active_project, updated_at)
```

#### API Endpoints Working:
- `GET /api/projects/` - List user's projects
- `POST /api/projects/switch/` - Switch active project  
- `POST /api/projects/create/` - Create new project
- `DELETE /api/projects/{id}/delete/` - Delete project

### ✅ Recently Completed (Current Session)

**Dataset Moving Between Projects** - Fully implemented
- Added green Move button to dataset cards
- Created modal for selecting target project
- Implemented `/api/datasets/{id}/move/` endpoint
- Added audit trail logging with ProjectActivity model
- Tracks both source and target project activities

### 🎯 Next Session Goals

#### 1. Enhanced Project Features
**Priority: Medium**
- Project member management (invite users, change roles)
- Project settings/edit functionality
- Project visibility controls implementation

#### 2. UI Polish
**Priority: Low**
- Add loading states to modals
- Improve error handling messages
- Add confirmation for destructive actions

### 🐛 Known Issues - RESOLVED ✅

1. ~~**Duplicate File Bug**: Fixed - Upload validation now scoped to project, not user globally~~
2. **User Authentication**: Ensure all users have proper project memberships  
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle projects with special characters in names
4. **Performance**: Consider pagination for projects list if users have many

### 🔧 Recent Bug Fix (Session End)

**Duplicate File Upload Bug** - RESOLVED ✅
- **Problem**: Upload failed with "already uploaded" when uploading same file to different projects
- **Root Cause**: Duplicate check was global per user, not per project
- **Solution**: Changed `Dataset.objects.filter(owner=request.user, fingerprint=...)` to `Dataset.objects.filter(project=active_project, fingerprint=...)`
- **Result**: Users can now upload same file to multiple projects, but duplicates within same project are still prevented

### 🗂️ File Organization

#### Models Structure:
```
Project (main container)
├── ProjectMembership (user permissions)  
├── UserProjectPreference (active project tracking)
├── ProjectActivity (audit trail)
└── Dataset (belongs to project)
    └── RawDataPoint, Analysis, etc.
```

#### Key Functions:
- `get_or_create_active_project(user)` - Ensures user has active project
- `openProjectSwitcher()` - Opens project selection modal  
- `switchToProject(id, name)` - Changes user's active project
- `createProject()` - Opens project creation modal

### 🔧 Technical Notes

#### Database Relationships:
- `Dataset.project` (ForeignKey) - Which project owns the dataset
- `ProjectMembership.user` + `ProjectMembership.project` - User access control
- `UserProjectPreference.active_project` - Current working project

#### Permission System:
- **Owner**: Full control (create, edit, delete project, manage members)
- **Admin**: Manage datasets and members (cannot delete project)
- **Member**: Upload datasets, run analysis
- **Viewer**: Read-only access

#### Frontend State:
- Project switcher modal dynamically generates from API data
- Dataset cards filtered by active project only
- Upload dropzone shows current active project name

### 🚀 Quick Start for Next Session

1. **Verify current state**: Check that project switching works correctly
2. **Focus on dataset moving**: Add UI elements to dataset cards for moving
3. **Implement audit trail**: Start logging ProjectActivity for all actions
4. **Test edge cases**: Multiple projects, project deletion, permissions

### 📋 Current Todo List State

```
[1. ✅ completed] Update upload system to use active project
[2. ✅ completed] Create active project display card
[3. ✅ completed] Add project switcher functionality
[4. ✅ completed] Filter dashboard datasets by active project
[5. ✅ completed] Create API endpoint to switch active project
[6. ✅ completed] Implement dataset moving between projects
[7. ✅ completed] Add audit trail for dataset moves
```

All planned features have been successfully implemented! ✨

### 💡 Implementation Details

**Dataset Moving Feature:**
- ✅ Green Move button added to dataset cards
- ✅ `moveDataset()` function shows project selection modal
- ✅ Modal excludes current active project from list
- ✅ `/api/datasets/{id}/move/` endpoint handles the move
- ✅ Frontend removes card immediately after successful move

**Audit Trail Implementation:**
- ✅ ProjectActivity model already exists with flexible structure
- ✅ Logs both "dataset_move_out" (source) and "dataset_move_in" (target)
- ✅ Stores metadata including dataset/project IDs and names
- ✅ Timestamps automatically tracked

The codebase is in excellent shape and ready for the next development phase! 🎉
